::: {#hero-heading}

Hello, I am *Naznin Akter*.

Currently pursuing my MS in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering. With a keen interest in molecular biology, veterinary biotechnology, cancer research, and bioinformatics, I am passionate about both wet and dry lab work. I aim to contribute to impactful research through a blend of experimental and computational approaches. In addition to my academic pursuits, I also work as a freelance data analyst on Fiverr, where I apply my analytical skills to solve diverse biological and healthcare-related data problems.
