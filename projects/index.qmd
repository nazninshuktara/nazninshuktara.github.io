  This page provides a mix of two types of listing, grouped by `id`.
listing:
  - id: ehr
    max-description-length: 500
    image-height: 150px
    fields: [image, title, description]
    contents: 
      - project_1
      - project_2
    type: grid
    grid-item-border: false

This is an example of **grid** listing. You can specify the content in the `yaml` header in the `.qmd` file. 

It is convenient to use `id` to link to multiple folders.
